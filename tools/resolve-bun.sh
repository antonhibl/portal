# Tried in order:
#   1. BUN, an explicit choice: if it is unusable, fail instead of replacing it.
#   2. bun on PATH, when it is compatible.
#   3. Portal's pinned Bun (bun.manifest), cached in PORTAL_TOOLS_DIR.
#   4. The pinned Bun downloaded from its official release, verified against
#      the manifest's digest before it runs, then cached.  PORTAL_BUN_DOWNLOAD=0
#      turns downloads off.
# A compatible Bun has Bun.markdown.html and is at least the pinned version.
# Nothing global changes: no shell configuration, no installed Bun.  The
# choice and any fallback are reported on standard error.
